Hi fellow Gitters,

Giles here,
Learning to use this tool...
I'm graduated in dentistry, specialized in orthodontics,
and have been working in public health management for the last 8 years.

Working with data all this time led me to perceive the necessity to learn
more and more ways to capture the necessary information.

Joining github as one of the first steps in a course from gamaacademy in Brazil

I already have some knowledge in Python, excel, google sheets, PowerBi, Google Data Studio.

Have a nice day!
